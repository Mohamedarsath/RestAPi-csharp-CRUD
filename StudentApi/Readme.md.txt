I created rest api in ado.net to perform crud operation with sql server

First of All you need a Sql Server to run this api
Install SSMS to manage sql Server
Create database and name
Create a Table with these values I used or you can define your own datas
Insert Some Datas to get output 
Write Stored procedure for insert,update,delete
Modify the name of Server in source and database in  Catalog in Controller
 based on your servername and db name.
You can use Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio to run this Program.
Thats it You are done.
I Think This api example will help you to learn basic api creation of crud operation.
